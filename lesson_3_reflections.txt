When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You want to use remote repositories so that if anything happens to your local
    computer, the work will not be lost. It also will enable collaboration with 
    other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If more than one person is working on a file at the same time, and Git tried
    to automatically sync everything, there could be merge conflicts. This way,
    by forcing it to be done manually, if there are merge conflicts, they can 
    be resolved individually when a push/pull is intentionally started.
